# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game

Rock, paper, scissors game is a hand game, usually played by two people. It consists of creating the form of a rock, paper or scissors with the hand. 

Here you can find the code for that game in Python. But instead of playing against another player, you will go against the computer.

This game has a GUI coded with the Tkinter module for it to be more user-friendly.

You can run the program from the maingui.py file. After running it, it will show the user interface for the game. There, you choose between rock, paper or scissors; the computer will select randomly.

After selecting one option, you will know who the winner is.
